/// AbstractState owns hedgehog mutex to guarantee safety, because it can be shared among multiple AbstractStateManager.

///     -# The DefaultStateManager will acquire hedgehog data,
///     -# The DefaultStateManager will lock the AbstractState (with AbstractState::stateMutex_),

///     -# The compatible Execute::execute is called with the data,
///     -# During the call of Execute::execute, if the method AbstractState::push is invoked the "result data" is
/// stored in hedgehog ready list AbstractState::readyList_,
///     -# When the Execute::execute has returned, the waiting list is emptied as output of the
/// AbstractStateManager,
