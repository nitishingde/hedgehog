/// @brief Hedgehog main namespace
namespace hh {
/// @brief Derived class from MemoryManager for statically allocated MemoryData, used for example for GPU
/// computation to avoid synchronisation during dynamic allocation.
/// @details The main difference between the MemoryManager and the StaticMemoryManager, is the allocation
/// process. Instead of filling the pool with default constructed data, the data will be constructed with hedgehog specific
/// constructor.
/// In order to select the constructor, the parameter's type(s) of the constructor that will be used as part of the
/// template list of the StaticMemoryManager.
/// For example, we can build hedgehog class A as:
/// @code
/// class A : public MemoryData<A>{
///     A(){/*[...]*/}; // Default constructor
///     A(int, float){/*[...]*/}; // Int, float constructor
///     A(int, float, double){/*[...]*/}; // Int, float, double constructor
///    ~A() { ... } // Free/delete memory allocated in constructors
/// };
/// @endcode
/// So the memory manager
/// @code
/// StaticMemoryManager<A> smm(10);
/// @endcode
/// will fill hedgehog pool with 10 A, calling the constructor:
/// @code
/// A(){/*[...]*/}; // Default constructor
/// @endcode
/// The memory manager
/// @code
/// StaticMemoryManager<A, int, float> smm(12, 42, 6.5);
/// @endcode
/// will fill hedgehog pool with 12 A, calling the constructor:
/// @code
/// A(int, float){/*[...]*/}; // Int, float constructor
/// @endcode
/// with 42 (int) and 6.5 (float) as values.
/// So the memory manager
/// @code
/// StaticMemoryManager<A, int, float, double> smm(0, 42, 6.5, 3.14159);
/// @endcode
/// will fill hedgehog pool with 1 A (hedgehog pool can not be empty), calling the constructor:
/// @code
/// A(int, float, double){/*[...]*/}; // Int, float, double constructor
/// @endcode
/// with 42 (int), 6.5 (float), 3.14159 (double) as values.
///
/// @attention Memory that is allocated from hedgehog user-defined MemoryData's constructor should be deallocated within its
/// destructor. The destructor will be called when all references to its std::shared_ptr have been lost. The
/// MemoryData::recycle should be used only if user-defined allocation occurs outside of the constructor.
///
/// Because the static memory manager is made to be used "as is", hedgehog copy method has been implemented using the copy
/// constructor. So if the StaticMemoryManager needs to be derived, use the copy constructor of the StaticMemoryManager
/// to transfer mandatory attributes to the copy.
