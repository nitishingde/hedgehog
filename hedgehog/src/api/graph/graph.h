/// Hedgehog graph abstraction.
/// @brief The graph in the Hedgehog library allows the user to create a dataflow. The graph regroups a set of nodes
/// representing parts of the computation. The most important nodes are the tasks (for heavy computation), the state
/// managers (to manage the local state of the computation) and the graph themselves (nested computation).
///
/// If a node is set as input of the graph (Graph::input / Graph::inputs), the data sent to the graph are transmitted to
/// the input nodes. The output nodes (set with Graph::output / Graph::outputs) produce the output data of the graph.
/// Between the input and the output nodes, the nodes need to be connected via edges(Graph::edge / Graph::edges).
///
/// A graph can be duplicated with ah hh::AbstractExecutionPipeline. Useful for mapping data across multiple devices (such as GPUs).
///
/// The difference between the singular and plural method (Graph::input / Graph::inputs, Graph::output / Graph::outputs,
/// Graph::edge / Graph::edges) is/are the type[s] used for the connection: if it is plural the connection is made for
/// all possible types, if it is singular the connection is only made for the user specified type.
///
/// The sequence of operations to use a graph are:
///     - Instantiate a graph [See example]
///     - Populate the graph [See example]
///     - Run the graph (Graph::executeGraph)
///     - Push data into the graph (Graph::pushData)
///     - Indicate that no more data will be pushed (Graph::finishPushingData)
///     - Gather output data with Graph::getBlockingResult can be put in a while loop, the function returns nullptr when the
/// graph is terminated (with Graph::finishPushingData) and all data have been processed.
///     - Wait for the graph to fully terminate (Graph::waitForTermination)

/// @attention The conformity rules are: 1) for the input nodes, the node and the graph should share at least one input
/// type, 2) for the output nodes, the node and the graph should share at least one output type and 3) between two nodes
/// an edge can only be drawn for [a] common type[s].
/// @attention If the process wants to push a certain amount of data / get the output and start with new input
/// data, the Graph::pushData and Graph::getBlockingResult can be alternated without the while loop because the graph
/// won't terminate. This technique can only be used if the number of output can be deduced in advance by the end user.
/// Once all processing is complete, then the user must indicate they are done with Graph::finishPushingData, otherwise
